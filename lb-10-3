HIGH:
You are given a 3D numpy array representing a colored image. Each pixel in the image has three values corresponding to the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) channels. Write a function convert_to_grayscale that converts this colored image to a grayscale image using the following formula:
Gray=0.2989×Red+0.5870×Green+0.1140×Blue

import numpy as np
def convert_to_grayscale(image):
    if image.shape[2] != 3:
        raise ValueError("The input image must have three channels (RGB)")
    grayscale_image = (0.2989 * image[:, :, 0] + 
                       0.5870 * image[:, :, 1] + 
                       0.1140 * image[:, :, 2])
    return grayscale_image
image = np.random.rand(100, 100, 3)  # Example colored image
grayscale_image = convert_to_grayscale(image)
print(grayscale_image.shape)
print(grayscale_image)
