#4.Develop a program that takes a user's temperature as input and outputs 
#whether they have a fever or not (considering a fever if temperature is equal to or above 100.4°F or 38°C).

tem=(input("Enter the temperature : "))
if tem>=100.4 and tem>=38 :
    print("You are suffering from fever!")
else:
